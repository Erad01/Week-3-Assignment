Required
ðŸŽ¯ What requirements did you achieve?
I was able to achieve the basic requirement.

ðŸŽ¯ Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
I was not able to achieve all of the stretch requirements.

ðŸŽ¯ If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
Basically it was just my timing. I got stuck on a bug for long until i realised i did not call a particular function.

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.
I guess its just how to do some of the stretch goals like animations and so. I did not have a clue at time of finish. And since there was not enough time left i left them.

What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)?
I watched some youtube videos to suppliment the knowledge gotten from classes and also had some discussion with coleagues to to be able to understand certain processes and solutions in the clicker game

What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?
I had called a function and later i did not see it work again. It was after mush struggle that i realise i had deleted the call function by mistake. Infact I thought my system was broken at a time and I had to create another repository from the one i had started with. So when te error persisted i realised it could be my code.

What went really well and what could have gone better?
Seeing the outcome of the work was what went really well. It could have been better though.
